# Hanab Live Game Logic

This package contains the rules for the game. These are exported as functions like `isCardTouchedByClue`, `isCardOnChop`, and so on. You can see the full list of functions on the [auto-generated documentation](./docs/modules.html).

Additionally, it can compute the next game state, given an existing game state and a game action (via the `gameReducer` function).

## Installation

If you want to use the game logic in a bot or some other Hanab-related program, then you can install it from npm:

```sh
npm install @hanabi-live/game --save
```
