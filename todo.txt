- remove type assertions from lobby + views
- redo install instructions without choco
- refactor START_CARD_RANK from 7 --> 0 (might affect database?)
- search for "This message is unnecessary"
- search for "TODO: remove. This is unused"
- delete UIGlobals.activePlayerIndex

short term:
- move "build_client.sh" and "esbuild_dev.sh" out of "client" directory
- get rid of all identity functions in "packages/client/src/game/rules/variant.ts"
- refactor `ignoreNegative`, I don't think it should be created inside of the reducer

long term once the server is rewritten in TypeScript:
- server should send message about if this is the player's first initial load, then we can use that in the soundView.ts to not play the initial sound effect on first turn refresh
- change server WebSocket authentication style: https://github.com/Hanabi-Live/hanabi-live/issues/2845
  - once this is done, we don't have to use client-side cookies anymore, can remove `@fastify/secure-session` dep entirely
  - will also have to generate argon2 hash on client side so that the hash can be stored in local storage
- delete "metadata" table from "database_schema.sql" + "test_key" thing
- refactor chat_log to have foreign key for user_id + boolean for server message
- refactor ActionNoteList to be one array of objects instead of multiple arrays (and the other various note things)
- refactor `order` --> `cardOrder`
- stronger typing for `disconShadowingSeat` field
- remove -1 type from activePlayerIndex (prefer undefined)
- readonly turn: number; // TODO: remove. This is unused.
